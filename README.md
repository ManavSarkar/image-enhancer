# Building image enhancer

## Idea

Many people click photos in hurry or have a low quality camera and then they want to enhance the image. This project aims to enhance the image by using a deep learning model.

This application is going to be a freemium product with a free version and a paid version. The free version will have a limit on the number of images that can be enhanced per day. The paid version will have no such limit.

## How to interact with the application

The application will be a web application. The user will upload the image to be enhanced and then the application will enhance the image and show the enhanced image to the user. The user can then download the enhanced image.

## Privacy

The application will not store the images uploaded by the user. The images will be deleted after the user downloads the enhanced image.
